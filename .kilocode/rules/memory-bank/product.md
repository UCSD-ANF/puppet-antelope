# Product Overview

## Purpose
The puppet-antelope module provides comprehensive Puppet-based configuration management for the Antelope Real-Time Monitoring System by Boulder Real-Time Technologies (BRTT). This module is specifically designed and maintained for use by the UC San Diego Array Network Facility (UCSD-ANF).

## What Problem It Solves
- **Infrastructure Management**: Automates the deployment, configuration, and management of Antelope installations across multiple systems
- **Service Management**: Provides sophisticated service orchestration for real-time seismic monitoring systems
- **Multi-Version Support**: Manages multiple concurrent Antelope versions on the same system for testing and production environments
- **Configuration Standardization**: Ensures consistent configuration across different environments and systems
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces manual configuration overhead for complex seismic monitoring infrastructure

## Core Functionality
1. **Antelope Installation Management**: Manages the base Antelope software installation and configuration
2. **Instance Management**: Creates and manages multiple Antelope service instances with different users and configurations
3. **Real-Time System Management**: Configures and manages real-time system directories and permissions
4. **Synchronization**: Provides tools for synchronizing Antelope installations from golden master systems
5. **Facts Collection**: Provides comprehensive system information about installed Antelope versions and capabilities
6. **Service Integration**: Manages system services, init scripts, and service dependencies
7. **PHP Integration**: Enables Antelope PHP extensions for web-based interfaces
8. **MCollective Integration**: Provides remote management capabilities through MCollective agents

## Target Users
- **System Administrators**: Managing seismic monitoring infrastructure at research institutions
- **DevOps Engineers**: Automating deployment and configuration of scientific monitoring systems
- **Seismologists**: Operating real-time earthquake monitoring networks
- **Research Facilities**: Organizations running BRTT Antelope systems for geophysical monitoring

## Key Benefits
