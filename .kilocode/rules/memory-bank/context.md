# Current Context

## Project State
The puppet-antelope module is a **mature, production-ready Puppet module** currently at version **1.1.9**. It's actively maintained by UCSD-ANF and uses modern Puppet development practices with PDK (Puppet Development Kit) version 1.18.0.

## Current Work Focus
- The module is stable and fully functional for its intended use case
- Built using modern Puppet 4+ features including data types and Hiera 5
- Supports Puppet versions 4.10.0 through 6.x
- Compatible with multiple operating systems: RedHat/CentOS 6-7, Darwin 14-16

## Recent Changes
Based on the CHANGELOG.md structure, the module appears to be actively maintained but currently in a stable state without recent major feature additions. The version numbering suggests incremental improvements and bug fixes.

## Next Steps
The module is feature-complete for its current scope. Future work would likely involve:
- Modernizing for newer Puppet versions (7.x support)
- Adding support for newer operating system versions
- Potential compatibility updates for newer Antelope versions
- Enhanced testing coverage or CI/CD improvements

## Key Operational Notes
- Uses `/opt/antelope` as the standard installation base directory
- Manages multiple concurrent Antelope versions (5.2-64 through 5.5+)
- Integrates with system service management on Linux and Darwin
- Provides comprehensive Facter facts for system discovery
- Supports both single and multi-instance deployments

## Development Status
- Active maintenance mode
- Stable API with backwards compatibility
- Well-documented with comprehensive README
- Full test coverage with RSpec
- CI/CD pipeline configured with multiple platforms
