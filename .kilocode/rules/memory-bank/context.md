# Current Context

## Project State
The puppet-antelope module is a **mature, production-ready Puppet module** currently at version **4.1.4**. It's actively maintained by UCSD-ANF and uses modern Puppet development practices with PDK (Puppet Development Kit) version 3.4.0.

## Current Work Focus
- **Architectural Modernization**: Focus has shifted to improving maintainability and consistency
- **Shared Utility Patterns**: Implementing reusable components across Puppet and Facter
- **Enterprise Documentation**: Comprehensive YARD documentation with detailed examples
- **Testing Excellence**: 87 comprehensive test cases with cross-validation
- Built using modern Puppet 4+ features including data types and Hiera 5
- Supports Puppet versions 4.10.0 through 6.x
- Compatible with multiple operating systems: RedHat/CentOS 6-7, Darwin 14-16

## Recent Changes
**Version Comparison Synchronization Project (2025):**
- **New Shared Architecture**: Created `lib/antelope/version_utils.rb` as centralized utility module
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Fixed bit suffix comparison logic affecting version ordering
- **Function Modernization**: Updated `antelope::version_compare` to use shared logic
- **Facter Integration**: Enhanced Facter utility to extend shared module
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added 87 test cases with integration validation
- **Enterprise Documentation**: Added detailed YARD documentation throughout
- **Code Standards**: Removed deprecated Puppet validation functions for 8.x compatibility

**Critical Infrastructure Fix (August 2025):**
- **Syntax Error Resolution**: Fixed critical syntax error in `lib/antelope/version_utils.rb` that was blocking 25 test cases
- **Test Suite Recovery**: Restored full test suite functionality from 212/237 passing to 237/237 passing
- **Shared Utility Architecture**: Unblocked the version comparison synchronization project implementation
- **CI/CD Pipeline Restoration**: Resolved automated testing pipeline failures caused by Ruby syntax errors
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Comprehensive documentation added to prevent similar future issues

**Development Infrastructure Improvements (August 2025):**
- **Kilo Code Integration**: Added `.kilocode/mcp.json` exclusion to `.gitignore`
- **PDK Protection**: Configured `.sync.yml` with `unmanaged: true` for `.gitignore` to prevent PDK from removing custom entries
- **Development Workflow**: Secured development tool configuration against automated overwrites

**Comprehensive Fact Consolidation and EPP Template Modernization (August 2025 - v4.1.4):**
- **Template Modernization**: Converted S99antelope.erb to modern S99antelope.epp with explicit parameter passing
- **Fact System Consolidation**: Merged all Antelope facts from lib/facter/antelope/* into single lib/facter/antelope.rb
- **Perl Version Detection Fix**: Resolved original issue where S99antelope template couldn't find Perl version facts
- **Testing Streamlined**: Consolidated 4 separate test files into comprehensive spec/unit/antelope_facts_spec.rb
- **Code Quality**: Fixed RuboCop style issues and ensured clean validation
- **Reliability Improvements**: Enhanced error handling and fact loading consistency

**GitHub Release Automation Implementation (August 2025 - Latest):**
- **Complete Automation**: Added comprehensive `ghrelease` Rake task for GitHub release workflow
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automatic version increment (major/minor/patch) in metadata.json
- **Safety Validation**: Multi-layer validation (git status, PDK, GitHub CLI, remote config)
- **Flexible Input**: Multiple commit message methods (CLI, environment variable, interactive editor)
- **Professional Output**: Auto-generated release notes with technical details and installation instructions
- **Workflow Integration**: Complements existing puppet-blacksmith module:release for Puppet Forge
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README_GHRELEASE.md with examples and troubleshooting

## Next Steps
The new shared utility architecture provides a foundation for future improvements:
- **Puppet 7.x/8.x Support**: Leverage modern shared patterns for compatibility updates
- **Extended Version Logic**: Apply shared utility pattern to other version-dependent features
- **Testing Framework**: Use comprehensive testing model for new feature development
- **Documentation Standards**: Apply enterprise YARD documentation patterns module-wide
- Adding support for newer operating system versions
- Potential compatibility updates for newer Antelope versions

## Key Operational Notes
- Uses `/opt/antelope` as the standard installation base directory
- Manages multiple concurrent Antelope versions (5.2-64 through 5.5+)
- Integrates with system service management on Linux and Darwin
- Provides comprehensive Facter facts for system discovery
- Supports both single and multi-instance deployments

## Development Status
- Active maintenance mode
- Stable API with backwards compatibility
- Well-documented with comprehensive README
- Full test coverage with RSpec
- CI/CD pipeline configured with multiple platforms
