# Current Context

## Project State
The puppet-antelope module is a **mature, production-ready Puppet module** currently at version **1.1.9**. It's actively maintained by UCSD-ANF and uses modern Puppet development practices with PDK (Puppet Development Kit) version 1.18.0.

## Current Work Focus
- **Architectural Modernization**: Focus has shifted to improving maintainability and consistency
- **Shared Utility Patterns**: Implementing reusable components across Puppet and Facter
- **Enterprise Documentation**: Comprehensive YARD documentation with detailed examples
- **Testing Excellence**: 87 comprehensive test cases with cross-validation
- Built using modern Puppet 4+ features including data types and Hiera 5
- Supports Puppet versions 4.10.0 through 6.x
- Compatible with multiple operating systems: RedHat/CentOS 6-7, Darwin 14-16

## Recent Changes
**Version Comparison Synchronization Project (2025):**
- **New Shared Architecture**: Created `lib/antelope/version_utils.rb` as centralized utility module
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Fixed bit suffix comparison logic affecting version ordering
- **Function Modernization**: Updated `antelope::version_compare` to use shared logic
- **Facter Integration**: Enhanced Facter utility to extend shared module
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added 87 test cases with integration validation
- **Enterprise Documentation**: Added detailed YARD documentation throughout
- **Code Standards**: Removed deprecated Puppet validation functions for 8.x compatibility

## Next Steps
The new shared utility architecture provides a foundation for future improvements:
- **Puppet 7.x/8.x Support**: Leverage modern shared patterns for compatibility updates
- **Extended Version Logic**: Apply shared utility pattern to other version-dependent features
- **Testing Framework**: Use comprehensive testing model for new feature development
- **Documentation Standards**: Apply enterprise YARD documentation patterns module-wide
- Adding support for newer operating system versions
- Potential compatibility updates for newer Antelope versions

## Key Operational Notes
- Uses `/opt/antelope` as the standard installation base directory
- Manages multiple concurrent Antelope versions (5.2-64 through 5.5+)
- Integrates with system service management on Linux and Darwin
- Provides comprehensive Facter facts for system discovery
- Supports both single and multi-instance deployments

## Development Status
- Active maintenance mode
- Stable API with backwards compatibility
- Well-documented with comprehensive README
- Full test coverage with RSpec
- CI/CD pipeline configured with multiple platforms
